# üöó Proactive Vehicle Health Monitoring Project

Welcome to the Proactive Vehicle Health Monitoring Project! In this project, we aim to develop a predictive maintenance model for vehicle health using machine learning. This project is designed to identify potential failures before they occur, ensuring the longevity and reliability of critical components.

# üìÅ Project Structure

**Data Loading and Exploration:**

Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the available features and target variable.

Visualized the sensor data and operational settings to identify potential patterns.

**Data Preprocessing**

Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and removed unnecessary features.

Scaled the data to improve model convergence and accuracy.

**Feature Engineering**

Created meaningful features from the available data to capture important signals related to component degradation.

Extracted time-based features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

**Model Training**

Trained multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

**Model Evaluation**

Evaluated the models using RMSE, MAE, and NASA Score to measure their effectiveness.

Used cross-validation for robust performance estimation.

**Final Model Selection**

Selected the best performing model based on overall metrics.

Exported the model for real-time prediction use cases.

# üìä Model Evaluation Metrics

The final model achieved the following results on the FD001 test set:

RMSE: 16.9993 (Lower is better, indicates average prediction error)

MAE: 12.3167 (Lower is better, measures average absolute error)

NASA Score: 600.2058 (Lower is better, measures overall model performance)

# üìå Key Observations:

The RMSE and MAE values are relatively close, indicating the model is not significantly overestimating or underestimating the remaining useful life (RUL).

The high NASA Score suggests there might still be room for improvement, possibly through additional feature engineering or fine-tuned hyperparameters.

# üöÄ Future Improvements

Experiment with advanced feature engineering, like moving averages and rolling statistics.

Use deep learning models like LSTMs for capturing sequential dependencies.

Optimize the hyperparameter tuning process further.

Explore ensemble methods for improved generalization.

# ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical approach to predictive maintenance for vehicle health monitoring. The current model provides a solid foundation, but with further refinement, it can become a highly reliable solution for real-world applications.
